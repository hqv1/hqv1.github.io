It was getting a little long in the tooth and running slow on Windows 11, so a year back I decided to give Linux a try. And it was great! I've been using it as a development system and Linux Mint gave this dusty laptop a second life. There were a few downsides though.</p> <ul> <li>Closing the lid didn't suspend the laptop. Many times I would come back to a steaming hot laptop with no battery life left. This may be a configuration issue, but I haven't researched it.</li> <li>System doesn't suspend on its own. I need to manually suspend the computer. Again, this may be a fix, but I haven't looked.</li> <li>Battery life isn't great. I'll probably get 3.5 hours on my normal workflow.</li> <li>Not a gaming laptop. I primary use the laptop for development work, so this wasn't a major issue...till now.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"general/2023-02-laptop-setup-01/#a-new-laptop-appears","title":"A New Laptop Appears","text":"<p>I'm planning a trip to India in a few months and wanted to bring a laptop to develop, play games, and watch movies without having to always scramble for power.
