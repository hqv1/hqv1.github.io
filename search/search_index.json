It was getting a little long in the tooth and running slow on Windows 11, so a year back I decided to give Linux a try. And it was great! I've been using it as a development system and Linux Mint gave this dusty laptop a second life. There were a few downsides though.</p> <ul> <li>Closing the lid didn't suspend the laptop. Many times I would come back to a steaming hot laptop with no battery life left. This may be a configuration issue, but I haven't researched it.</li> <li>The system doesn't suspend on its own. I need to manually suspend the computer. Again, this may be a fix, but I haven't looked.</li> <li>Battery life isn't great.
